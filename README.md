# Predict Home Price

## Overview
<b>Machine Learning Project</b> created with <b>Python</b> using California home price dataset to predict prices of homes in California.
Project was created using the <b>TensorFlow</b> framework and <b>scikit-learn</b> library to build models to try to accurately predict home prices.

    <li>The <a href = "PredictHomePrice/accuracy.py">Accuracy</a> <b>Python</b> file created to test accuracy of model.</li>
</ul>


## Motivation
This project was created to learn more about <b>TensorFlow</b> and learn more about <b>Machine Learning</b> ensemble methods.
By creating different models using different ensemble methods such as KNeighbour, RandomForest, and GradientBoostingRegressor, 
I was able to understand more about the way these methods worked and were effective under what conditions.
